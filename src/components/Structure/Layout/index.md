# Layout

The layout component is used to create the main layout on a page. Layouts sections come in three main configurations: one-column, two-column, and annotated. One and two column layouts can be combined in the same page. Annotated layouts should be used on their own and only on settings pages.

## Examples

Use for settings pages. When settings are grouped thematically in annotated sections, the title and description on each section helps clients quickly find the setting theyâ€™re looking for.
